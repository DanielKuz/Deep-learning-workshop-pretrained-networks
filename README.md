# Deep-learning-workshop-pretrained-networks
This is a repositry for making the networks we were reading for the Deep learning workshop BGU course.
- [ ] AlexNet
- [ ] VGG
- [ ] Inceptionblock - GoogleNet
- [ ] Resnetblocks - ResNet
- [ ] Dense layers- DenseBlock- Transition layer-DenseNet
- [ ] ResNext
- [ ] WideResnet
- [ ] Inception V3
- [ ] Inception V4
- [ ] LSTM
- [ ] Transformers
- [ ] RCNN

And more to come
All Networks will be done according to the paper only assuming same input as the paper.
